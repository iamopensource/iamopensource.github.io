ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to "i am open source". Our mission is to inspire new contributions to open source projects from those who have yet to participate. Contributing to open source can be really intimidating for people of all skill levels and backgrounds. Through the stories posted on the site we hope to show that you're not alone. Opening a first PR, first issue, or even commenting can seem insurmountable. However, all of the people featured in the coming posts have one thing in common--they all overcame that initial hurdle and started to contribute through commenting, opening pull requests, or even maintaining.

If you would like to share your experience contributing to open source, [we would love to hear from you](https://github.com/iamopensource/iamopensource.github.io/issues/new).
