        <p>Getting started with open source can be difficult--<a href="https://iamopensource.github.io/">i am open source</a> is a place to show new comers that anyone (from any background) can contribute just about anything from a single character typo to a whole new feature. We use the GitHub API to pull in first time contributions from repos that use <a href="https://github.com/behaviorbot/welcome">behaviorbot welcome</a> to welcome new contributors and we currate stories from individuals who have jumped into open source.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/hiimbex">@hiimbex</a> wrote a blog post called <a href="https://medium.com/@hiimbexo/gaining-my-voice-in-open-source-21c8c1ac0eee">Gaining my voice in open source</a> and it really resonated with a lot of first timers. Bex raised a couple of concerns that seemed to plague a lot of us who would like to contribute but haven't yet found solid footing to get started. Ultimately a fear of not having previous contributions and a difficulty identifying with the majority of the community left open source projects devoid of Bex's unique voice and exctiment to contribute. This is a huge missed opportunity for the community and for Bex. <a href="https://github.com/hiimbex">@hiimbex</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anglinb">@anglinb</a> set out to help fix this.</p>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <h4>Dispelling Contribution Misconceptions</h4>
        <p>A lot of new comers to open source have an idea of what "a contribution" is and what their excepted role is supposed to be. However, many of these definitions limit new comers--fixing a typo in docs or embellishing an under-documented feature is something that no one wants to do but will greatly help future contributors. These kinds of contributions are perfect for new comers because fixing docs is still exciting and command over a language like English might come more natural than command over a programming language. Some people's first open source contribution is helping translate documentations to make a project more accessible to everyone.</p>
        <h4>Defining an Open Source Identity</h4>
        <p>Technology as a field has had its issues with under-representation of certain groups. A lot of really smart people are building education and professional programs to help people from under-represented groups gain the knowledge to make it in technology. However, another element of being a contributor is feeling like you belong. We want to use <a href="https://iamopensource.github.io/">i am open source</a> as a platform to share personal stories from people of all backgrounds and their journey into open source. The hypothesis here is that seeing someone that you identify with because they share your ethnicity, sexuality, gender, etc will help show you that you <em>can</em> identify as an open source contributor no matter who you are.</p>
